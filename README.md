# DnDMP
Dungeons and Dragons Map Player

# Notes
1. Maps are made of 1s and 0s
2. 1s are walls
3. 0s are walk space
4. 8 is the player
5. It will copy from a default map to a map under your name so you need to make a default map
6. It has NOT BEEN stress tested for multiple people using it
7. It has no other use other than moving an 8 around a txt file
8. It was my second attempt at making anything using discord API so its bad.
